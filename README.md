# XML-Resume
XML Resume Project using my own XML, XSLT, and maybe some schema definitions down the road.

This started as an independent project for my last month at my High School. I had already written my Resume in HTML and CSS, and thought it'd be nice to develop a schema to have a resume in a machine readable format, with the added boon of being able to create templates that could easily be loaded up with anyone's information. I missed the mark in a few facets on my first pass, but I try to use this as my personal resume as much as possible, so hopefully that motivates me to make it as good as possible.
